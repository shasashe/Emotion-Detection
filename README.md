ðŸ˜„ Emotion Detection from Images using DeepFace & OpenCV
This project performs facial emotion detection using the DeepFace library and applies various OpenCV image processing techniques to enhance and analyze facial structures. It is designed to run smoothly on Google Colab.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Detects emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc. from face images
Uses DeepFace's pre-trained facial analysis models
Applies OpenCV techniques like:
Grayscale conversion
Thresholding
Contour detection
Convex hull drawing
Edge detection
Visualizes all stages with Matplotlib

Technologies Used
Python
Google Colab
DeepFace
OpenCV
Matplotlib
NumPy

Future Improvements
Allow batch processing of multiple images
Integrate gender, age, and race detection from DeepFace
Deploy a frontend using Gradio or Streamlit
